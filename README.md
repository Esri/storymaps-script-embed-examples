# ArcGIS StoryMaps script embed examples

This repository is intended for sharing samples of script-embedded ArcGIS StoryMaps stories. Embedding stories using a script-embed is a developer-friendly pathway for customizing your stories and implementing custom functionality.

## Features

Embedding stories in your webpage usings `<script>` tags enables you to:
- [Embed the story within a webpage within your own domain](/getting-started/README.md).
- [Wrap the story in your header and footer](/header-footer/README.md).
- [Open the story with a splash page or pop-up](/splash-page/README.md).
- [Replace the fonts in your story with self-hosted fonts or those from a font delivery service.](/font-replacement/README.md)
- [Implement your own analytics](/analytics/README.md).

## Instructions

Each sample folder within this repository demonstrates a specific use case and contains:
- **HTML** index.html file that acts as the main webpage with a script-embed of an ArcGIS StoryMap story.
- **CSS**  style.css file containing rules for overriding the styling of elements within a story.
- **Javascript (optional)** javascript.js file containing code to manipulate content of the webpage.
- **README** A read me document that outlines the use case for the sample, how to implement it, and a link to a live example (if applicable).

The contents of these files can be copied and modified to suit your needs and hosted on your webserver.

### Embedding a story using script tags
Within the HTML `index.html` file a script tag is used to embed the story.

```html
  <!-- Embedded story -->
  <div class="storymaps-root"></div>
  <script
    id="embed-script"
    src="https://storymapsstg.arcgis.com/embed/view"
    data-story-id="<UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_STORY_ID>"
    data-root-node=".storymaps-root"
  ></script>
```
